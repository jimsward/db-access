db-access.php loads default settings, and scripts, creates db-access menu page and settings page, calls the gettables.js script.
Gettables.js requests all the database's table names, builds a dropdown from which the user selects a table and builds a
HTML table.
The table has the following features:
Sortable
Filterable*
Printable*
Pagination*
Exportable as a .cvs file*
Columns selectable/removable*
Crosshairs*
Individual cells fully editable*

* => set/unset in the settings page

To make crosshairs work, lns 65 and 76 in tablesorter/css/theme.default.css commented out

Since ie (even ie 11) won't allow contenteditable of td elements, I had to insert a textarea child node for each <td>

In widgets-editable.js changed line 90, 91: from $this.html() to $this.val() twice since $this now refers to textarea element.

For updates we use wpdb->query(); it doesn't SQL escape the text.
